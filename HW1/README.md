Problem Statement
------
Suppose we toss darts randomly at a square dartboard, whose bullseye is at the origin, and whose sides are two feet in length. Suppose also that there is a circle inscribed in the square dartboard. The radius of the circle is one foot, and its area is Ï€ square feet. If the points that are hit by the darts are uniformly distributed (and we always hit the square), then the number of darts that hit inside the circle should approximately satisfy the equation
